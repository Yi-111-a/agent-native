"@agent-native/core": patch
---

Require a session on `POST /_agent-native/speak`, and bound the request before
it is parsed. The route previously enforced authentication only in production
and otherwise resolved `OPENAI_API_KEY` anonymously, so an unauthenticated
caller on any other deploy could spend its speech credits. It also parsed the
whole body before checking the script length, and never bounded `instructions`.
Callers that relied on anonymous synthesis now receive 401.

An anonymous caller is answered with the `no-provider` result rather than 401,
because that is the one reason the client starts browser speech: a no-login
reader would otherwise hear nothing instead of the local voice. No provider key
is resolved for them either way.
